  "ecosystem.desc_1": "Created from authentic .243 caliber shell casings that were once part of a fired cartridge. Each casing retains subtle marks of its history. These marks give the pen its unique character and soul.",
  "ecosystem.desc_2": "Each piece is handcrafted with attention to the smallest details. Precise processing, careful shell selection, and fine finishing make every pen one of a kind – perfect as a collectible item, original gift, or luxurious accessory for those who value items with soul.",

It has a pleasant weight that gives a sense of quality and longevity, while also fitting comfortably in the hand. Writing with it is incredibly smooth and effortless, requiring little pressure, turning every note into a pleasure.",
  "ecosystem.title_2": "Available in Two Finishes",

  "ecosystem.title_3": "Personalization",
  "ecosystem.desc_5": "The pen allows slight personalization. By default, there's an external spacer between the two shells, which adds a distinctive look and extends the construction. However, if someone prefers a more compact form – the spacer can be easily removed, allowing the shells to touch directly, giving the pen a shorter, more raw look. A simple modification to match your style.",
  "ecosystem.title_4": "Mechanism",
  "ecosystem.desc_6": "The pen mechanism works by twisting the shell, causing the refill to extend or retract. Replacing the refill is just as easy – remove the rear shell, unscrew the used refill, and screw in a new one. This intuitive solution combines functionality with the unique nature of the pen.",
